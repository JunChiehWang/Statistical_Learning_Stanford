00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:04,680
Well, we have a guest here today, Dr. John Chambers.

1
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:07,080
John was the inventor of the S language, which is the

2
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:10,795
language that we use in R. John was also my department

3
00:00:10,795 --> 00:00:13,920
head at AT&amp;T Bell Labs when I worked there in

4
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,550
the &#39;80s and &#39;90s.

5
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:18,030
So John, welcome.

6
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:18,990
Great to be here.

7
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:22,540
Thank you and please tell us about S and how it became R.

8
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:23,950
It&#39;s an interesting story actually.

9
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:26,840
It&#39;s an interesting combination of ideas, and the

10
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:29,680
context for the ideas and outside events that we had no

11
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:31,370
control over.

12
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:34,900
It has a very specific birth-date actually, which is

13
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:38,390
the 5th of May, 1976.

14
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:41,400
And that was a day on which five of us at Bell Labs in

15
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,730
Murray Hill sat down in the little conference room and

16
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:46,070
started to talk about what we might do to create an

17
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:49,010
interactive system, as we called it at that time.

18
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:49,880
But it&#39;s very important.

19
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:53,970
It&#39;s part of the story that was far from the beginning of

20
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:56,030
statistical computing research at Bell Labs.

21
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:58,460
My own involvement had gone on for more than a

22
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:00,510
decade before that.

23
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:04,340
And as a another example, about a year before that, we

24
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:08,110
hired a really bright young guy named Rick Becker.

25
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:10,590
And Rick and I, the first thing that we worked on

26
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:15,140
together was a system of software for statistical

27
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:17,870
graphics, for scatter plots and other kinds of things like

28
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:19,900
that called GRZ.

29
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:22,780
And you&#39;ve probably never heard of GRZ, but you&#39;ve used

30
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:26,420
it because the base graphics in R is essentially designed

31
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:29,140
on the way that we structured GRZ.

32
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:31,370
Never knew that.

33
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:33,840
And in addition, we had lots of other software.

34
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,350
Numerical software, random number generation, data

35
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:39,120
management, all that kind of stuff.

36
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:42,990
The catch was, that all of it was in the form of FORTRAN

37
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:44,650
call subroutines.

38
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:47,750
So in order to use it, people had to construct a FORTRAN

39
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:51,080
main program, job control, and all that kind of stuff.

40
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,720
And the result was that there was a delay, and lots of

41
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:56,350
people were involved, and by the time you&#39;ve got the

42
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:59,650
results back you&#39;d kind of forgotten what the idea was in

43
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:00,670
the first place.

44
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:04,550
So our goal was to provide an interactive system, where the

45
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:07,390
people actually doing the statistical analysis, or doing

46
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:10,639
the research, could sit down themselves and express what

47
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,960
they wanted in some fairly natural way and get the

48
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,930
results back right away.

49
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:18,510
But, at the same time, and this is also important, we

50
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:22,120
wanted them to still have access to the best

51
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,740
computational methods that existed, regardless of where

52
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:28,140
they came from, or who had written them and including

53
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:29,810
things that would be developed later on.

54
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:31,960
So that was the basic philosophy.

55
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:34,510
And when you think about it, that&#39;s not a bad description

56
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:38,760
of what we&#39;re trying to do nowadays with R. So in the

57
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:42,270
first, next few months we did put together an initial

58
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:45,920
version of the system and started to have people use it

59
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,135
in the statistics research area and other colleagues at

60
00:02:49,135 --> 00:02:50,760
Murray Hill.

61
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:54,620
That takes us to sort of late in the 1970s,

62
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:57,400
around 1978 or so.

63
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:01,635
And, meanwhile, the next event on the floor above us at

64
00:03:01,635 --> 00:03:04,350
Murray Hill, there were some guys in computer science

65
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:07,450
research who were busy creating a new kind of

66
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:12,640
operating system, which eventually was called Unix.

67
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:17,100
And in particular, around 1978 or so, the new version of Unix

68
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:17,780
was developed.

69
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:22,230
It was based on the C programming language, and was

70
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:25,470
portable amongst different computers.

71
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:28,300
In particular, it was portable to 32-bit machines, which

72
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,920
meant that it was now a candidate for

73
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,010
doing scientific computing.

74
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:33,650
Before it had been on a 16-bit machine.

75
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:36,040
Rick and I immediately realized that this was the way

76
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,320
that we were going to get a portable version of S,

77
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:41,200
something that we had been worrying about for awhile.

78
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,220
So in the late &#39;70s, we rewrote S to use the C

79
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:48,420
language and Unix operating system.

80
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:51,860
That was the first version that was licensed for people

81
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:54,170
outside of AT&amp;T to use.

82
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:58,470
And there too, we piggybacked off Unix because the Unix

83
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:02,870
folks had arranged with AT&amp;T to license their software,

84
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:04,330
their operating system.

85
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:08,190
And in particular, to license it with a very favorable rate

86
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:10,770
to universities, basically free to universities, just for

87
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:12,840
the cost of copying the tape.

88
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,040
We managed to get the same arrangement for S, and so, at

89
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:19,010
that point, we started to have outside users, mainly

90
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:21,829
universities where there was a lot of interest in statistics,

91
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:23,170
in computing, and things like that.

92
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:26,650
Carnegie Mellon, Toronto, Berkeley.

93
00:04:26,650 --> 00:04:30,690
And John, was that S very similar to what we use today?

94
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:32,170
Not so similar.

95
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:34,780
There were two books that Rick and I wrote

96
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:35,860
that describe that.

97
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:38,685
If you looked at it and just looked at what somebody had

98
00:04:38,685 --> 00:04:41,310
written down say to do a linear regression, it would

99
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:42,320
look similar.

100
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,860
But as soon as you started to do anything nontrivial, it was

101
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:46,580
very different.

102
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:49,860
And, in fact, that&#39;s sort of the next part of the story.

103
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:53,060
So then some other events started to take place.

104
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:57,470
One was that in 1981, I left statistics for a few years and

105
00:04:57,470 --> 00:04:59,550
went to head what was called the Advance Software

106
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:00,830
Department.

107
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:06,060
Their job was primarily to produce computing tools for

108
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:07,970
the company, particularly for what would

109
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:09,820
nowadays be called analytics.

110
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:12,280
And so while I was there, I started to look at some other

111
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:15,620
ideas and programming languages and started to write

112
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:18,300
a new language, a different language called a quadratic

113
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:20,480
programming environment, which originally wasn&#39;t going to

114
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:23,720
have any connection directly to S at all.

115
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:26,660
But while all that was happening, on a much, much

116
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:32,050
larger scale, AT&amp;T, the old Bell system, agreed to be

117
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:35,830
split up, to divest itself of all of the local telephone

118
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:39,000
companies, in response to an anti-trust suit from the

119
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,410
federal government.

120
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:43,610
This took place between 1981, 1983.

121
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:48,370
As part of that, Bell Labs spun off a fair fraction of

122
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:51,080
itself, including research, to a new company called Bell

123
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:54,340
Corp. And as part of the rearrangements and

124
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:57,500
reorganizations and everything that went on at that time, I

125
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,035
came back to statistics as head of the Statistics and

126
00:06:00,035 --> 00:06:02,380
Data Analysis Research Department.

127
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:04,560
And Rick and I got back together.

128
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,260
And we decided to merge the sort of stuff I&#39;ve been

129
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:11,080
working on with what he&#39;d been doing to improve S itself, and

130
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:14,750
to create a new version, what we call the New S Language.

131
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:18,710
And a book that describes that.

132
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:20,770
That&#39;s probably the first one I got to know.

133
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:21,940
It probably is.

134
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:24,620
There were few universities who got into the old S, but

135
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:29,360
this is when S began to really take off with universities and

136
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,895
research labs, and to some extent, third party resellers.

137
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,860
And then, of course, as you very well know, we went on to

138
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:41,540
also produce the Statistical Models in S effort that you

139
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:42,950
and I edited.

140
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:46,420
And along with that came the first version of object

141
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:48,370
oriented programming for S.

142
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:52,820
So this takes us now to the middle--

143
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:56,540
I notice how much more play that book gets than this

144
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:58,740
grubby old blue book.

145
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:01,260
Anyway, so that now takes us to about the

146
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:05,350
middle of the 1990s.

147
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:08,200
Things were kind of taking off and doing quite well.

148
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:13,000
And now, we come to the next event, which is in 1996.

149
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,740
Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman published a paper on

150
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:19,900
something they just called a language for data analysis and

151
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:25,350
graphics, and just happened to have the name R.

152
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:30,370
So this expressed some ideas, particularly Ross had about

153
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:32,090
better ways to do some of the things that were done.

154
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:36,050
But as Ross was prone to say in talks at the time, it was a

155
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:42,300
language that was not unlike S. And in fact, once it was

156
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:46,420
out there, there&#39;s a lot of enthusiasm amongst a number of

157
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:50,330
people to make it into a free open source

158
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:53,070
clone of the S language.

159
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:56,680
Over the next few years, in the late 1990s, a group, which

160
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:00,000
came to be called R Corp, got together and did that.

161
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,170
Ross and Robert very wisely and very generously,

162
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:06,920
transferred control over R to the R Corp group.

163
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,640
And at that point, it really started to take off.

164
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:13,590
And the process was to replicate the facilities that

165
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:16,270
were described in the blue book, and for the most part,

166
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:19,210
in the white book in a new open source

167
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:21,570
and portable language.

168
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:23,660
And that&#39;s R.

169
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:27,380
The event there, which also has a very specific date, was

170
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:30,510
on February 29, 2000, which by the way, is

171
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,190
a very unique date.

172
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:36,710
And on that date version 1.0 of R was produced.

173
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:39,630
I wasn&#39;t part of R Corp at that time, but I was very

174
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:43,169
friendly with them and one of my most treasured souvenirs is

175
00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:46,800
serial number one of the CD-ROMs that were produced at

176
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:51,090
that time for R, autographed by all the members of R Corp.

177
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:53,570
Very treasured memento.

178
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:56,450
So that basically, in a sense, that was it.

179
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:58,270
And the rest has kind of been history.

180
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:02,520
R has really taken off and has introduced a number of

181
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:06,120
additional ideas that we never had and there are now millions

182
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:10,780
of users and many thousands of packages and on the whole,

183
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:13,645
it&#39;s a great thing, and I&#39;m just overwhelmed by it all.

184
00:09:13,645 --> 00:09:16,250
Well, I think that the generations of statisticians,

185
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:19,530
that today&#39;s generation, can be really grateful for this.

186
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:20,500
R is wonderful.

187
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,540
I&#39;ve used it for the last 10 years.

188
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:22,900
Love it.

189
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:24,560
Have written packages to.

190
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,500
And it&#39;s just such a wonderful environment to be able to work

191
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,770
in, and it&#39;s free.

192
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:32,050
So really good and very high quality.

193
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:34,490
I think the most important thing from my point-of-view is

194
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:37,720
that it&#39;s had a very strong effect, I&#39;d almost be tempted

195
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:40,720
to call it a revolutionary effect, in the way new results

196
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,730
in statistics are communicated.

197
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:44,940
Used to be, people would just write a paper and then you

198
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:46,860
would write to the author and try to figure out if there is

199
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:49,010
some way you could implement what he&#39;d done in

200
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:50,680
some form or other.

201
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:54,510
For many things now, not all, but many things now, people

202
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:57,760
produce the code, they produce an R package, and instantly,

203
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:01,010
everyone else can use what they&#39;ve got freely and

204
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:02,660
contribute their ideas to let things evolve.

205
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:06,410
And that I think is, to my mind, the most beneficial

206
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:07,580
result that&#39;s happened.

207
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:09,090
Well, thank you very much, John.

208
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:09,690
My pleasure.

209
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:12,280
John retired from Bell Labs a few years back, and we&#39;ve

210
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,250
managed to lure him to Stanford where he is a

211
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:17,450
consulting professor in the Statistics Department.

212
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:18,700
Thanks very much.
