0
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:04,500
So that&#39;s a good segue into what do we do when we have

1
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:05,810
more than one variable.

2
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:09,590
The two models we&#39;ve considered so far just perform

3
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:11,460
logistic regression with single variables.

4
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:15,640
But of course, if we&#39;ve got a collection of variables, we

5
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:18,190
want to take them all into account.

6
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:22,100
And so, in that case, we&#39;re going to build a multi-variant

7
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:24,330
logistic regression model.

8
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:27,660
So the transformation of the probability is the same as we

9
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,715
had before, except now we&#39;ve got a general linear model

10
00:00:30,715 --> 00:00:32,810
with an intercept and a coefficient

11
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:35,270
for each of the variables.

12
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:37,980
And if you invert that transformation, that, again,

13
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:40,300
gives you a form for the probability that&#39;s guaranteed

14
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:41,710
to be between zero and one.

15
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:46,740
Well, we can fit that using glm and r

16
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:48,720
just like we did before.

17
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:51,830
And we&#39;ll through in our variable balance as well, and

18
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:54,730
income, and the student variable.

19
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:58,810
And now, we get three coefficients, three standard

20
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:08,330
errors, three z statistics, and three p values.

21
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:12,190
And the first thing we see here is that as they were in

22
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:16,010
the single variable case, balance and student are

23
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:18,470
significant.

24
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:20,730
Income is not significant.

25
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:22,745
So it seems like two of the variables are important.

26
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:27,700
But here&#39;s something rather striking.

27
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:30,000
We know this at the coefficient for student is

28
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,020
negative while it was positive before.

29
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:38,510
So before, when we just measured student on its own,

30
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:40,700
it had a positive coefficient.

31
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:43,090
But when we fit it in a multivariate model, the

32
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:44,595
coefficient is negative.

33
00:01:44,595 --> 00:01:47,930
Do you think this is an error, Rob?

34
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:50,660
I don&#39;t think so.

35
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:53,070
So how could that happen?

36
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:55,380
Well, remember the last time we talked about in regression

37
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:58,690
models how difficult it is to interpret coefficients in a

38
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:02,150
multiple regression model, because the correlations

39
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:05,130
between the variables can affect the signs.

40
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:06,770
So there&#39;s going to be--

41
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:08,080
we&#39;re going to see now the role of

42
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,440
correlations in the variables.

43
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,080
So here&#39;s a picture.

44
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:18,320
There we see credit card balance.

45
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:26,460
And we see the default rate the vertical axis.

46
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:32,480
And the student center of, let&#39;s see--

47
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:40,280
so students status, brown is yes and blue is no.

48
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,510
So students tend to have higher balances than

49
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:43,670
non-students.

50
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:46,730
So their marginal default rate is higher than for

51
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:49,390
non-students.

52
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:50,720
Because we just saw that.

53
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,420
Balance plays a role.

54
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:56,130
But what we see in this plot on the left is that for each

55
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:59,260
level of balance, students default less than

56
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,510
non-students.

57
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:06,370
So when you just look at student on its own, it&#39;s

58
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:09,420
confounded with balance.

59
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:13,710
And the strong effect of balance makes it looks like

60
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:16,990
students are worse defaulters.

61
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:18,910
But this plot explains it all.

62
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:23,520
For each level of credit card balance, if we look separately

63
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:27,250
for students and non-students, students tend to have a lower

64
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:30,080
default rate.

65
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,520
And so that we can tease out by multiple logistic

66
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:38,280
regression, which takes these correlations into account.

67
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:42,290
Let&#39;s move on to another example with more variables.

68
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:45,730
We talked about this example in the introduction.

69
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:49,180
This is a South African heart disease data set.

70
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:51,535
Remember, South Africans eat a lot of meat.

71
00:03:51,535 --> 00:03:54,580
Rob, did I ever tell you the story about the

72
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:55,930
South Africans and--

73
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:56,770
More than once.

74
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:57,980
More than once.

75
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:01,460
I think Rob doesn&#39;t want to hear the story again.

76
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:03,160
Any way, they do eat a lot of meat.

77
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,842
So they did a study in South Africa.

78
00:04:05,842 --> 00:04:08,420
It was a retrospective study.

79
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:14,710
They went and found 160 cases of white males who&#39;d had

80
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:17,220
myocardial infarction, which is a fancy

81
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,200
name for a heart attack.

82
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:22,910
And amongst the many people who hadn&#39;t had a heart attack,

83
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:25,670
they took a sample of 302 controls.

84
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:28,440
It&#39;s called a case control sample.

85
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,930
And for these people, they were all white males in the

86
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:33,030
age range 15 to 64.

87
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:35,110
And they were from this Western Cape

88
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:36,780
region of South Africa.

89
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:41,460
This was done in the early 1980s.

90
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:46,200
So in this region, the overall prevalence was very high for

91
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:51,620
heart disease, 5.1%, which is very high risk.

92
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:54,810
So in the study we have measurements on seven

93
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:58,610
predictors or, in this case, known as risk factors.

94
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:01,550
And they show in the scatter plot matrix, which I&#39;ll show

95
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:03,420
you right here.

96
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:05,880
Remember, the scatter plot matrix is a very nice way of

97
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:09,290
plotting every variable against every other variable.

98
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:13,160
And now, because it&#39;s a classification problem, we can

99
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:17,300
code into the plot the heart disease status.

100
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:21,850
And so the brown or red points here are those cases that had

101
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:23,110
heart disease.

102
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:28,110
And the blue points are the controls.

103
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:32,040
And look at the top plot, for example, if you were high in

104
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:36,270
tobacco usage and your systolic blood pressure is

105
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:39,950
high, you tend to be a brown point.

106
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:45,470
To those are the people who tended to have heart attacks.

107
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:48,920
So each of these plots shows a pairwise plot of two of the

108
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:51,180
risk factors and codes in the heart disease status.

109
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:52,490
You forgot one risk factor.

110
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:53,660
What was that?

111
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:55,096
Talking with a funny accent.

112
00:05:55,096 --> 00:05:56,840
Talking with a funny accent.

113
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,090
We&#39;ve all got that.

114
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,763
Very good, Rob.

115
00:06:01,763 --> 00:06:03,760
I&#39;m doing all the hard work here.

116
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:06,100
And he&#39;s just sitting here thinking of jokes.

117
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:09,200
The coffee&#39;s good, too.

118
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,890
There&#39;s one funny variable here, family history.

119
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:13,575
Well, it&#39;s a categorical variable.

120
00:06:13,575 --> 00:06:16,880
It turns out to be an important risk factor, apart

121
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,740
from being South African or not.

122
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:20,270
If you have a family history of heart

123
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:24,000
disease, the risk is high.

124
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,790
And you can see that it&#39;s a zero-one

125
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:26,690
variable in this case.

126
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:29,650
And you probably can see there&#39;s more browns in the

127
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:33,550
right-hand category than the left-hand category.

128
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:37,500
So in this case, we&#39;re not really trying to predict the

129
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,410
probability of getting heart disease.

130
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:43,500
What we&#39;re really trying to do is to understand the role of

131
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:50,320
the risk factors in the risk of heart disease.

132
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:53,730
And actually, this study was an intervention study aimed at

133
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:56,210
educating the public on healthier diets.

134
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:57,750
But that&#39;s a whole other story.

135
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:58,950
Did it work?

136
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:01,820
Um, I think it might have worked a little bit.

137
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,620
But this crowd is really hard to get them

138
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:06,286
away from their meat.

139
00:07:06,286 --> 00:07:08,340
Do you know that they call a barbecue in South Africa?

140
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:09,680
No.

141
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,016
Braaivleis.

142
00:07:11,016 --> 00:07:12,266
OK.

143
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:16,660
Every South African loves their braaivleis and their

144
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:18,270
bull tongue.

145
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:23,310
So here&#39;s the result of GLM for the heart disease data.

146
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:24,650
And here I actually show you some of the

147
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:26,440
code used to fit it.

148
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,560
We&#39;ll get into the code session later.

149
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,120
But it&#39;s just interesting to see that it&#39;s

150
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,450
pretty easy to do.

151
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:34,700
Here&#39;s a call to glm.

152
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:42,460
We tell it the response is CHD, which is the name of the

153
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:44,080
response variable.

154
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,460
And tilde means to be modeled as.

155
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:49,640
And dot means all the other variables in the data frame

156
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,020
which, in this case, is heart.

157
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:53,600
So that&#39;s a data frame that&#39;s got all the

158
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:57,060
variables in the study.

159
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:59,140
And the response here is CHD.

160
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:02,390
And we tell it the family&#39;s binomial, which just tells it

161
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:05,480
to fit the logistic regression model.

162
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,430
And then we fit that model.

163
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:10,610
Save it in the object called heartfit.

164
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:13,550
And then we do a summary of heartfit.

165
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:16,620
And we get printed out this summary, which is the same

166
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:19,320
summary that we&#39;ve seen before.

167
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:22,530
And so now we get coefficients for each of the variables.

168
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:25,890
In this column, we get standard errors, c

169
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:29,170
values, and p values.

170
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:32,150
And here the story is a little bit mixed.

171
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:33,929
We&#39;re not too interested in the intercept.

172
00:08:33,929 --> 00:08:37,720
Tobacco usage is significant.

173
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:41,909
Low density lipoproteins, that&#39;s a cholesterol measure,

174
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:43,900
that&#39;s significant.

175
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:46,550
Remember, there&#39;s a good and bad cholesterol.

176
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:48,590
This is the bad cholesterol.

177
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:52,040
Family history, very significant.

178
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,100
And age is significant.

179
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:56,620
We know the risk of heart disease goes up with age.

180
00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:01,910
Now, interest in the obesity and alcohol usage are not

181
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:07,758
significant here, which seems a little surprising, no?

182
00:09:07,758 --> 00:09:09,174
Mm hmm.

183
00:09:09,174 --> 00:09:13,410
But this is a case, again, of having correlated variables.

184
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:17,720
If we look in the previous plot, you see that there is a

185
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:20,790
lot of correlation between variables.

186
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:26,700
So age and tobacco usage are correlated.

187
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:32,860
Alcohol usage and LDL seem to be negatively correlated.

188
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:36,350
LDL is the good cholesterol.

189
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:37,730
So there&#39;s lots of correlations.

190
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:40,690
And so those are going to play a role.

191
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:42,960
And so, for example, we&#39;ve got LDL is

192
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,700
significant in the model.

193
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:48,850
And once LDL is in the model, perhaps alcohol usage is not

194
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:49,490
needed anymore.

195
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:51,050
Because it&#39;s been taken care of.

196
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:53,120
These variables act as surrogates for each other.
